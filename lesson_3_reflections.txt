When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
	The obvious case is when working on a project that involves multiple contributors 
	since the remote repository will allow everyone to work simultaneously and at the 
	same time allow them to include others' work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	That's because sometimes you make changes locally that you don't want them overidden 
	if Git automatically stayed up-to-date and for example restored a file present on the
	remote that you deleted on your local repository.
