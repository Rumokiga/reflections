When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
	The obvious case is when working on a project that involves multiple contributors 
	since the remote repository will allow everyone to work simultaneously and at the 
	same time allow them to include others' work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	That's because sometimes you make changes locally that you don't want them overidden 
	if Git automatically stayed up-to-date and for example restored a file present on the
	remote that you deleted on your local repository. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	I'm not sure if branches are really comparable with the other two, so I'll start with it.
	In my own words, branches are sections of your projects, kind of, can be created 
	both locally or on the remote repo, commits should be done to them, that's all I 
	can think of for now. Now, clones are, as their name says, they are copies of 
	your work, your entire repository/project, you can clone from local to local, from
	remote to local and from remote to remote. This last one is actually a fork in
	GitHub's jargon, when you fork a repository in GitHub, you're just cloning it under 
	your profile in GitHub's server.
